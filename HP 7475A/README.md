# Models for HP 7475A

I printed all of these with PLA and standard 0.20mm settings and they seem to work fine.

- **Cover Tab** is a replacement for a broken-off tab on the transluscent cover. It needs to be superglued into place.
- **Curiousmarc Bravo Adapter** is a Pilot Bravo pen adapter based on the dimensions provided in [this video segment](https://youtu.be/h-oj4HrTH14?t=424) by Marc Verdiell. It seems good but I haven't tried it.
- **Pen Blank** is a solid pen outline that can be modified or bored out to derive adapters for non-original pens. It's based on dimension provided in this [blog post](https://softsolder.com/2015/04/21/hp-7475a-plotter-oem-pen-body-model/) by Ed Nisley.
- **Pinch Roller** is a model for the pinch rollers that grip the top of the paper. To use, press the print into a length of 5mm ID x 9mm OD aquarium tubing. I used [this tubing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3M7SK8?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2) and found that a [cutting tool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BD3JSB6?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) was well worth the minor expense.
- **Clamp** is a model for the clamps that hold the roller bearings on the underside of the paper stage. It is strong when printed in the proper orientation but I don't recall what that was, sorry.
- **Triplus Adapter** is a pen adapter for Staedtler Triplus Fineliner pens like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SV65VHB?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1). Print it pointy end down with supports. It should be snug but easy to snap on, and it should indeed snap like a cap. If it's too loose or too tight (these dimensions are not consistent across all my pen sets) you may need to adjust the drawing (Sketch038).
- **Triplus Block** is a storage block for pens in their adapters. It may work for any pen actually but I have only tried it with the Triplus adapters.
