# Models for Tektronix 454A

- **Large Foot** is a model for the main big stand-up feet on the back of the case. I don't know what the originals look like so I had to make it up.
- **Small Foot** is a model for the small metal feet that the scope rests on when in normal use. This is probably a standard part but I couldn't find it. Press an M3 threaded insert into the hole.
