# Models for Teletype Model 43

See my [restoration thread](https://mastodon.social/@tpolecat/113960210644010286) for photos of some of these models.

- **Paper Guide** is a model for the left paper guide (you can mirror it in your slicer to make the right paper guide). Use a stubby M3 press-fit inset for the hole on the top and an M2 inset on the outside. Attach a 5mm M2 standoff to make a pillar for the spring.
- **Nub** is a little extension nub for the page separator (mine had broken off). Need to superglue in place.
- **Ear** is a model for the ears that stablize the rear bustle cover.
- **Port**, **Card**, and **Card Lock** are for my homebrew RS-232 adapter (my TTY didn't have one) and probably aren't of general interest, but do let me know if you need to build one and I can share more info.
- **Interlock** is a replacement for the foam interlock switch that makes the warning light come on when you open the cover.
- **Thumb** is a replacement thumb tab for the cover.
